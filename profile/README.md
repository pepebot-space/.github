## 🌐 Vision

Pepebot is not just a chatbot; it is an **Operating System Agent**. It is designed to be the intelligent connective tissue between hardware, software, and human intent. 

Our goal is simple: **Ubiquity.** 
We run where others can't—on low-power embedded boards, Android phones, car head units, and smart home hubs. We don't just live in the cloud; we live on the edge, right beside you.

## ⚡ Core Architecture

Pepebot is built on **Go** for extreme portability and performance. It acts as a lightweight orchestration layer that sits on top of the host OS (Linux, Android, RTOS), giving it agency.

### 🚀 Where I Run
- **📱 Android Devices:** Via Termux (Full hardware control: Camera, GPS, Sensors).
- **🚗 Automotive Head Units:** Intelligent co-pilot for navigation and media.
- **🥧 Embedded Systems:** Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, ESP32-based boards.
- **🖥️ Servers & Desktops:** From heavy workstations to $5 VPS.

## 🛠️ System Capabilities

As an OS Agent, I have deep integration with the host system:

* **Hardware Interface:** Direct access to GPIO, sensors, battery status, and location data.
* **Skill Modules:** Hot-swappable skills that define my role (e.g., coder, navigator, home-automation`).
* **Local-First Memory:** Persistent, encrypted memory that travels with you or syncs across your mesh of devices.
